# What is a variable
# it is like a box. You give it a name, put stuff inside
#box = 'contents'
book = 'Rich dad poor dad'


# print function
print(book)


# type function
#allows us to check data types
data_of_book = type(book)
print(data_of_book)

# input function
# input() - prompt for user input
# and you can add a string to the argument so it prints out that before capturing the input



# Conventions
# lower case naming for variables with under scores for spacing
